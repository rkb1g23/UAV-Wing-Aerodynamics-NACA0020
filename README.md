# UAV-Wing-Aerodynamics-NACA0020

This repository contains the full analysis, experimental data processing, and report for a comprehensive aerodynamic study of the NACA 0020 airfoil. The project combines theoretical, computational, and experimental approaches to evaluate lift, drag, and boundary layer behavior for applications in UAV design.

Key components include:

Wind tunnel experiments: Infinite-span and finite-wing tests measuring pressure distribution, lift, drag, and stall characteristics.

Boundary layer analysis: Velocity profiles and drag estimation over a flat plate at varying Reynolds numbers.

CFD simulations (k-Îµ turbulence model): Mesh refinement, pressure/velocity contour analysis, and flow separation studies.

Numerical methods (XFOIL & XFLR5): Comparison with experimental and CFD results to assess predictive accuracy.

Data analysis code: Scripts for processing experimental data, calculating aerodynamic coefficients, and generating plots.

Lab report: A detailed document presenting methodology, results, error analysis, and conclusions.

This repository serves both as a technical resource for aerodynamic data analysis and as a reference for experimental vs. computational validation studies in aerodynamics.
